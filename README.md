# 🌊 Silk Mizu Browser
Simple and lightweight PyQT6 browser for Silk and Linux / Windows / Mac computers. Made possible through the QWebEngineView Widget for rendering webpages. Mizu (水) translates to "water" in japanese, which makes sense because you are "surfing" the web.

# ⭐️ Features
- Simple but still modern ui elements using the Awesome 6 icons and QT Dark theme
- Default search engine selection (Google, DuckDuckGo, Brave...)
- Custom start page selection
- Basic browser navigation features (e.g. going back a page)
- Accessability features (zooming, font size)
- Bookmarks and easy Bookmark management
- Silk-Start support

# ⚙️ Requirements
- `pyqt6` (pip)
- `pyqt6-webengine` (pip)
- `qtawesome` (pip)
- `pyqtdarktheme` (pip)
- `darkdetect` (pip)

# 🚀 Running the program
