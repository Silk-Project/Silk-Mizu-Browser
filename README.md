# 🌊 Silk Mizu Browser
Simple and lightweight PyQT6 browser for Silk and Linux / Windows / Mac computers. Made possible through the QWebEngineView Widget for rendering webpages. Mizu (水) translates to "water" in japanese, which makes sense because you are "surfing" the web.

## ⬇️ Getting the program
A normal git clone will result into missing submodules. Instead use this command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Silk-Project/Silk-Mizu-Browser.git
```
...or initialize the submodules later:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```


## 🚀 Running the program
To use this program, simply execute the main.py file directly via python3.
```
python3 main.py
```
## 💻 To-do
- [ ] improving website tab system and tab bar positioning at the top
- [x] "Explain selected text with AI" (partly)
- [ ] Reader view
- [ ] Better overview of current downloads so it can't infinitely stack up in the download menu
- [ ] Custom theme editor
